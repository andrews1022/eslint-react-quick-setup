# ESLint & Babel Quick Setup Guide

## Setup

The easiest way to get started is by using a React boilerplate, such as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Once Create React App is finished downloading, you can easily create an ESLint config by running: `npx create-react-app my-app-name-here`. Or simply run `npx create-react-app .` in a directory you have already created and named.
